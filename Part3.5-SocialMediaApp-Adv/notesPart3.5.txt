Continuation of Social Media APP by replacing postgress driver with ORM 
Instead of directly sending the sql code , we will send Python code to ORM which will convert it into SQL
SQLALCHEMY is not very good at changing the DB structure once its created. 
Alembic can be used to perform DB structure changes like schema or table contraints changes.

Use case : Social Media App Example using ORM | SQLALCHEMY 
    this helps to perform all DB operations through traditional python code. No more SQL!
    ORM will convert the python code into SQL and will use the same driver.
    
    Earlier approach:   {fastApi} <---SQL----> {DB}
    ORM approach:   {fastApi} <--python--> {ORM} <--psycopg|sql--> {DB}
