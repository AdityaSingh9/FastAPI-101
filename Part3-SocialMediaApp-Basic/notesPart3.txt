This is all about Postgres DB integration.
Use case : Social Media App Example using just postgress driver!

1. Connecting to database w/ Python
2. Database CRUD
3. psycopg2 driver 

Postgres driver? eg: psycopg2 or psycopg3.
    Driver = connector between Python & PostgreSQL 

Psycopg follows the Python DB API 2.0 standard, so its usage is similar to other DB adapters.
    You connect to a PostgreSQL database using connect(), which returns a connection object.
    From the connection, you create a cursor to run SQL commands.
    The cursor is used to:
        Execute SQL statements (execute(), executemany())
        Fetch query results (fetchone(), fetchmany(), fetchall())
        SQL parameters are passed safely using placeholders (%s) to prevent SQL injection.
    Changes are saved to the database using commit() (or reverted using rollback()).
    Finally, cursors and connections are closed to free resources.
