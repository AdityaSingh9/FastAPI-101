# FastAPI

FastAPI is exciting because it brings speed, simplicity, and performance together while still letting you build truly production-grade APIs.
Coming from low-code platforms like Mule 4, Workato, and Boomi, I’ve built and explored integrations and APIs extensively.
But I always wanted to go beyond configuration and actually code the systems behind those abstractions.
With the rise of AI, getting back to Python became mandatory, not optional.
FastAPI felt like the perfect bridge — modern backend development today, and a direct gateway to AI and GenAI tomorrow.
